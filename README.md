## Hi, I'm Umang Sehgal.

I specialise in leading product teams with a focus on SaaS and enterprise markets. As a product manager from a technical and creative background I'm drawn to challenging technical problems, exploring meaningful design and UX, and building communities of practice.

My journey began as a software developer and startup advocate at Evive Health, spinning out an internal project to become the lead PM of a collaborative weight management solution product.

In the two years of my journey in the United States, I went through the Okta Internship program and the experienced numerous courses in Data Science, User Experience and Product Management at the University of Washington. During which time I had the pleasure of living in Seattle, San Francisco, and Dallas. 

I'm in my last leg of graduate school education where I'm learning to be a PM for open source projects, and completing an MS in Information Management.

I'm currently running a bunch of side projects, including the The Five W's newsletter (To be launched soon)
